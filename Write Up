For my regression analysis, I used the same dataset from Assignment 2. From the dataset, I chose the variable math score as the continuous dependent variable. Then I chose parental level of education and test preparation course as the independent variables. I used R to build my multiple linear regression model. I loaded in the library tidyverse and then my dataset. I then built the model and examined the coefficients table. I decided to go with the significance level of 0.05 for my variables. From the coefficient table, I saw the statistically significant variables were parental education for high school, some college, some high school, and test preparation course taken was none. The variables that were not statistically significant were parental education for Bachelor’s degree and Master’s degree. The confidence intervals also look to be backing this conclusion based on the results for the confidence intervals for each variable.  I also saw that the error rate of the model is 22%. Based on these results my prediction is that the variables parental education for high school, some college, some high school, and test preparation course taken was none have an effect on math scores.
